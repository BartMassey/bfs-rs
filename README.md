# Breadth-First Search demo
Bart Massey 2023

This is a demo of reading an edge list from a CSV file,
building an undirected adjacency-list graph, and performing
BFS/Dijkstra search for a shortest path in the graph.

This was inspired by [this blog
post](https://www.confessionsofadataguy.com/exploring-graphs-in-rust-yikes/)
with the help of [Cunningham's
Law](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law).

The code is reasonably Rustic and shows some interesting-ish
techniques. There is light testing. The code has not been
benchmarked, but should be ~~blazingly fast~~ pretty quick.
